Project Overview


This React project aims to provide users with a comprehensive customization experience for various webpage elements. All customization data, including Navbar, Cards, Carousel, Pricing, and Footer, will be stored in MongoDB. The application will leverage separate pages for different element customizations, a preview page, and a positioning page.


Architecture


Frontend (React)


  - The frontend will feature distinct pages for element customizations.
  - Navbar Page:        Choose from various Navbar styles and configurations.
  - Cards Page:          Customize the appearance and content of cards.
  - Carousel Page:     Configure carousel settings.
  - Pricing Page:        Select and customize pricing components.
  - Footer Page:         Customize the footer section.
  - Preview Page:       View and copy the generated code/design.
  - Positioning Page: Arrange and position elements on the webpage.


Backend
- Authentication, Database, APIs: Utilize JWT for authentication, MongoDB for storing comprehensive customization data, and expose APIs for CRUD operations on user-specific elements.
